    <h1>Recipe Research: Classic French Madeleines</h1>
    <p>
      Madeleines are small French sponge cakes baked in shell-shaped molds with a soft, buttery texture and lightly crisp exterior.
      Often enjoyed fresh from the oven, they are simple in composition yet refined in presentation.

      <h2>Recipe Overview</h2>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>½ cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, plus 2 Tbsp (28g) for greasing the pan</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup (115g) sifted all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Optional: confectioners’ sugar, for dusting</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Melt ½ cup (113g) butter and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Using a mixer, beat eggs and sugar on high speed for about 8 minutes until pale, thick, and ribbon-like. Beat in lemon zest and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together. Gently fold into the egg mixture in two additions.</li>
        <li>Stir ¼ cup of the batter into the melted butter, then fold the butter mixture back into the remaining batter until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover and chill the batter for 30–60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Brush the madeleine pan with the remaining melted butter.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 generous tablespoon of batter into the center of each mold without spreading.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10–12 minutes, until the tops spring back when lightly pressed.</li>
        <li>Invert the pan to release the madeleines and transfer to a rack to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Dust with confectioners’ sugar, if desired, and serve warm.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></h4>
      <p>I was inspired by Apple's site after discussions about their intentional choice of images that guide the users eyes to a specific area of the screen.
        Additionally, Apple's use of hierarchy, consistent spacing, and color contrast can also translate well to organizing recipe steps and instructions.
