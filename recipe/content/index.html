    <h1>Classic French Madeleines</h1>
    <p>
      Small French sponge cakes baked in shell-shaped molds with a soft, buttery interior and lightly crisp exterior. Enjoy fresh from
      the oven or store at room temperature to experience their sweet, crispy flavor. Though simple in ingredients, their airy texture 
      and elegant shape make them feel refined in presentation.

        <h2>Serving, Storage, Timing Guide</h2>

        <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring eggs to room temperature (essential for proper volume).</li>
            <li>Melt butter first and allow it to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Whip eggs and sugar for a full 8 minutes until thick and ribbon-like.</li>
            <li>Chill batter for 30–60 minutes (do not chill longer).</li>
            <li>Grease madeleine pan with melted butter, even if nonstick.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C) during the final minutes of chilling.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Best served:</strong> Warm, cool for about 5–10 minutes after baking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Storage:</strong> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
          Madeleines are best enjoyed the day they are baked, as they tend to dry out quickly. Freezing is not recommended, as it significantly affects texture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Begin preparing batter around 1 hour 30 mins before serving. This allows time for mixing, chilling, baking, and slight cooling before serving warm.

      <h3>Non-Recipe Websites</h3>
  
      <h4><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></h4>
      <p>I was inspired by Apple's site after discussions about their intentional choice of images that guide the users eyes to a specific area of the screen.
        Additionally, Apple's use of hierarchy, consistent spacing, and color contrast can also translate well to organizing recipe steps and instructions.
