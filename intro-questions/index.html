    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Christine Jiang and I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science with minors in Electrical Engineering, HCI, and Econimics.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>I come from mostly a technical background with minimal design experience. My interests lie closely around hardware and software development 
                but I have taken an introductory design class here at WashU. I enjoyed experiementing with different creative elements in technical settings and 
                also grew an interest in human-centered design. By taking this class, I want to explore and build a strong foundation around interactive design,
                allowing me to create products that are technically advanced, design intentional, and user focused.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>I've built several projects using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Most of these projects are from class assignments while others are either small personal projects
                or simple web interfaces for larger technical projects.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Many projects I have experience with have a strong emphasis on the technical aspects. In this class, I hope to learn how to design for clarity and usability
                while still allowing room for creativity and experimentation.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Like the name of the class, I expect designing for screen to require more interactions, motion, and responsiveness while designing for paper is more static
                and fixed. Designing for screen also considers how users navigate, scroll, and overall interact with the content.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong>
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.muji.us/" target="_blank">MUJI</a>'s website exemplifies effective design through it's strong visual hierarchy, consistent spacing and typography,
                simple background, and neutral tone colors/images. The design choice supports MUJI's simple products and calm aesthetic. The site also includes contradicting features
                such as sharp edges, rectangular images, and quick hover transitions to balance the calmness and simplicity.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong>
            <br>
            <p><a href="http://rubiks.com/" target="_blank">Rubiks</a>'s site exemplifies effective communication, especially on the homepage. The interactive features all resemble a cube. The 
                image on the landing page turns different parts of the cube as you over the element and scroll on the page. Additionally, there are also several vertical and horizontal scroll
                factors as you scroll up and down the page. The other images on the site also face different faces of the cube revealing new images as you scroll. This feature puts emphasis on 
                what the site is trying to communicate--the cube. In addition to this, the typography, layout, and visuals all exemplify a game-like design.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong>
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>'s website because it balances visal appeal and usability. The interface is intuitive but also designed
                to imitate a traditional NYT paper. In addition to the unique design choice, it also organizes large amounts of information in a clear, readable structure. The typography, layout, 
                and visual cues work together and help readers understand what matters most.</p>
