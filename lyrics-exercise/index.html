        <div>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <br>
            <p>Make that money, fake that dummy, ache my tummy</p>
            <p>On the fence, all the time</p>
            <p>Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?</p>
            <p>All my friends always lie to me</p>
            <p>I know they're thinking</p>
            <br>
            <p>You're too mean, I don't like you</p>
            <p>Fuck you anyway</p>
            <p>You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs</p>
            <p>It hurts, but I won't fight you</p>
            <p>You suck anyway</p>
            <p>You make me want to die right when I</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might end up being me (being me, being me)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons</p>
            <p>Sell your soul, not your whole self</p>
            <p>Oh, if they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it</p>
            <p>And I can't even see if there's hope there anymore, so</p>
            <br>
            <p>You're too mean, I don't like you</p>
            <p>Fuck you anyway</p>
            <p>You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs</p>
            <p>It hurts, but I won't fight you</p>
            <p>You suck anyway</p>
            <p>You make me want to die right when I</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might end up being me (being me, being me)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Being me can only mean feeling scared to breathe</p>
            <p>And if you leave me, then I'll be afraid of everything</p>
            <p>That makes me anxious, gives me patience</p>
            <p>Calms me down, lets me face this, let me sleep</p>
            <p>And when I wake up (when I wake up), let me be</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might take my place</p>
            <p>When I wake up, I'm afraid</p>
            <p>Somebody else might end up being me (being me, being me)</p>
